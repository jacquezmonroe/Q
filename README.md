# Q — v0.1 voice loop

You hold Space and talk. Q transcribes what you said, thinks, and talks back. Everything runs on this Mac.

```
mic → whisper.cpp → Ollama (llama3.2:3b) → macOS voice → speakers
```

The point of this version is to **measure how fast Q answers on your actual Mac**. The Latency panel times every stage of every turn.

## First run (one time, needs internet)

1. Install **Ollama** from https://ollama.com/download and open it once.
2. Install **Homebrew** from https://brew.sh if you don't have it.
3. In this folder:

```bash
npm run setup     # installs whisper.cpp, downloads the speech model, pulls llama3.2:3b, builds the speech helper
npm start
```

4. Open http://127.0.0.1:4141 and allow the microphone when the browser asks.

After the first run you can start Q by double-clicking **`Start Q.command`** in this folder (or `bin/Q.app` itself). Q's window opens Ollama if needed, starts Q's server and shows a small orb in the top-right corner; the Terminal window the launcher opened can be closed. To stop Q, choose **Quit Q** from the **Q** menu bar item: that stops the server too. The server's output is in `~/Library/Logs/Q/server.log` (menu: Show server log). If the window isn't built, the launcher runs the server in the Terminal window and opens your browser, as before.

**Saved conversations.** Q keeps what you and Q say, as text, in one file on this Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Q/history.sqlite`. No audio is kept, nothing leaves the Mac, and nothing saved is fed back to the model. The History card in the panel shows what is kept and lets you pause saving, choose how long conversations are kept (90 days unless you change it), start a new conversation, delete the current one or delete everything. **Browse and search** opens a view of every saved conversation with keyword search; from there you can read one, continue it, export it (or all of them) as a Markdown file to your Downloads folder, or delete it. After a restart Q carries on the last conversation if it was active in the past six hours. Saving needs Node 22.5 or newer; on older versions Q runs without it and says so. To put the file somewhere else, set `historyFile` in `q.config.json`.

**Q's window** (`bin/Q.app`, built from `shell/` by setup or `npm run build:shell`) floats above other windows and adds a **Q** item to the menu bar. Hold **⌥Space** in any app to talk; inside the window plain Space works too. macOS asks for the microphone once. Right-click the orb for the same menu as the menu bar item (Open panel, Show server log, Quit Q). Click the orb for the full panel; closing the panel takes you back to the orb, it doesn't quit Q. The same page is at http://127.0.0.1:4141 in a browser while Q is running. If you started the server yourself with `npm start`, Q's window uses it and leaves it running when you quit. `bin/Q.app` has to stay where it is: it finds the Q folder from its own location. The build signs it with a signing identity from your keychain if you have one, so macOS doesn't ask for the microphone again after each rebuild; without one it is signed ad hoc and macOS will re-ask. While the window is running, ⌥Space no longer types a non-breaking space in other apps. If the window isn't built, the launcher opens the browser instead.

After setup, you can turn Wi-Fi off and Q still works.

## Using it

| | |
|---|---|
| Hold **Space** (or hold the mic button) | Talk. Let go to send. |
| **Esc**, Stop, or click the core | Interrupt Q mid-thought or mid-sentence. |
| Type in the box + Enter | Same loop without the mic. |

## How to read the Latency panel

**Key release → first audio** is the time from letting go of Space to hearing Q's first word. (Typed turns are timed from Enter and kept out of the statistics.)

- under 1.5 s: feels live
- 1.5–3 s: noticeable
- over 3 s: sluggish

The bar breaks that time into four stages:

- **Speech → text**: whisper.cpp transcribing you.
- **First token**: the model starting to reply (watch for a cold start on the first turn).
- **First phrase**: the model producing the first piece Q can speak. That is the first sentence, or, with "Start speaking at the first pause" on in the Voice panel, the first clause of at least three words.
- **Voice synth**: the macOS voice rendering that sentence to audio.

Under the bars, the panel shows p50 and p90 for warm and cold voice turns separately (p90 appears once a group has ten turns). **Copy run data** puts the timings for up to the last 200 turns on the clipboard as JSON, with memory and power figures sampled by the server: numbers only, never what was said. **Clear** deletes the stored timings.

Try it with VS Code and your browser open too, because that's how you'll actually use it.

## Making Q yours

- **Personality:** edit `persona.md`. Q re-reads it every turn, so you don't need to restart.
- **Voice:** pick one in the Voice panel. Q speaks through a small helper (`bin/q-speak`, built from `speech/q-speak.swift` by setup or `npm run build:speech`) that keeps the macOS voice loaded. Without it Q falls back to `say`, which adds over a second per sentence, and the System panel says so. The Voice engine menu can also switch to the browser's own speech, which only ever uses voices installed on this Mac. For better voices, go to System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → System Voice → Manage Voices and download a Premium or Enhanced voice. It will show up in the list.
- **Comparing Whisper models:** tick "Compare Whisper models on my voice" in the Voice panel and a second model (`small.en`, if it is in `models/`) hears each recording too. When the two disagree you see both and mark which was right; Q keeps the score, not the words. It uses about 600 MB more memory, so switch it off when benchmarking.
- **Quality test:** `node scripts/quality-run.mjs --label NAME` runs the prompts in `quality/prompts.json` through Q and saves the replies to `quality/out/` (not checked in). Run it twice, or once plus `--template cloud` filled in by hand, then open `/quality.html` to compare the two blind.
- **Staying responsive after a pause:** for 15 minutes after your last turn, while the Q page is open, Q pings the model, Whisper and the voice every 2 minutes so macOS doesn't compress their memory, and it wakes them the moment you press the talk key. Change `keepWarmSeconds` and `keepWarmMinutes` in `q.config.json`; set `keepWarmMinutes` to 0 to turn it off.
- **Model and other settings:** copy `q.config.example.json` to `q.config.json` and edit it. For example, set `"model": "qwen2.5:3b"` after running `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`. Restart Q after you change it.

## What's honest about the UI

The core animates only for real events:

- It pulses for listening only while the mic is recording.
- It shows thinking only while whisper or the model is working.
- It shows speaking only while audio is playing.

The System panel names the microphone Q is recording through, because the browser uses the system default and macOS can switch that without asking (a nearby iPhone becomes a Continuity microphone). If it changes mid-session, Q says so in the conversation. When the default becomes a wireless mic (AirPods, an iPhone), Q uses the Mac's built-in mic by itself and tells you, because a wireless mic cuts Q's voice mid-sentence. To fix the microphone yourself, pick a device under **Your microphone** in the Voice panel: Q then records from that device only, and tells you if it isn't connected instead of quietly using another.

Memory figures come from Ollama and the server process. The network note says what the code does: the server binds to 127.0.0.1 and calls no cloud services. It doesn't claim outbound traffic has been verified, because it hasn't been yet.

There are no npm dependencies. You need Node 20+. The speech helper needs `swiftc`, which comes with Xcode or its command line tools.
